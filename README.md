WAR

The Goal
Be the player to capture all the cards.

Setting Up the Game
Shuffle the cards.
Deal the cards between the players.
Players place their cards in a stack face down.

Playing the Game
Players turn over the top card of their deck and present it for "battle".

Cards rank from 2 (lowest) to Ace (highest).

Whoever turned over the higher valued card "captures" the opponents card and adds both cards face down to the bottom of their deck.

Both players turn over the next card and play continues.
If both players present cards of equal value they both lay down four cards. The first three cards are placed face down while the fourth is placed face up. The player whose fourth card is the highest captures all ten cards. If the fourth cards are equal the process is repeated until someone wins.

Winning the Game

The player that captures all the cards is the winner.
